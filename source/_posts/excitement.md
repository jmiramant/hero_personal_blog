The pinnacle of excitement was the 20 minutes before my family exchanged gifts on Christmas morning. I’d have been awake for hours when the clock would finally click to 5am, releasing me from my bed. 3:23… 

I anxiously willed the seconds hand on my clock to speed up and chisel away the eternity that had to wait. The seconds hand had different ideas. It was not keen to all the attention. Content to spin round and round the clock with the sole purpose of consistency, my unwelcomed focus made in rebel. It slowed to half time. 

The once soft tick, tock, tick, tock of each second became deafening against my pitiful attempts to sleep. The seconds hand of my cheap clock would sense my desperate efforts to swap anticipation with gentle dreams, and demand attention. The moments before joy, it became my biggest foe.
